# Cumulative_Accuracy_Profile
Cumulative Accuracy Profile on a ML model:
           Sometimes the accuracy score of the model may not 
      reflect its performance, so an alternative way that is 
      cumulative accuracy profile is used. It is graphical method as 
      you can see in the model. At the end the is score(percentage) 
      which tells about our model performance.
      <60 means worst model,
      60-70 => average
      70-80 => good
      80-90 => very good
      >90   => perfect (too good to believe, its better to check for overfitting in some cases)
